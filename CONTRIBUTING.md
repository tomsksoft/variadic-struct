# Code Contributions

Pull requests are our channel for code contributions. Here is a quick guide.

1. Fork the [variadic-struct](https://github.com/tomsksoft/variadic-struct) repo
2. Create a [feature](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#feature-branches) branch in your fork using ```develop``` branch as parent
3. Write the code changes; try to be consistent with our code style
4. Create a pull request with descriptive and clear commit message; make sure it can be merged automatically to ```develop``` branch

At this point, it's our turn. If you've done everything well, we may just thank you and merge your request. Otherwise, we may provide some comments or suggestions to steer the
contribution in the right direction.
